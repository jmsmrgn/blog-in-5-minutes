# blog-in-5-min

This is a fork of [blog-in-5-mins with contentful](https://github.com/contentful/blog-in-5-minutes).

However, this project is aimed only to one thing â€“ integrate with [contentful-wizard](https://github.com/Bloomca/contentful-wizard), which allows you to add interactive tooltips to all contentful-powered blocks.
